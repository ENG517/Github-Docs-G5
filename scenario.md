# *Reading to Learn to Do* Scenario

You just started your new position as a technical communicator at a software company. The company uses a docs-as-code methodology for their documentation that uses Github for their editorial workflow. The company's small, so you do not have anyone to support your onboarding experience. They want you to use Github Desktop and suggested the documentation site to learn how to add, clone, and make changes to the repo.

## How to Consider This Scenario

Consider this novice audience as your primary audience as you review and revise the existing docs.
